Modera Cloud uses Docker as the core component to model the infrastructure.
Therefore the principal question to be answered is whether you want to run the cloud:

- straight on your machine, or
- inside a virtual environment

If you are not on Linux then as of today you don't really have other options other than running it inside the virtual machine.
