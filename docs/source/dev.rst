Install mcloud as usual.

Clone repository from github (or use your own url from fork on github)::

    git clone git@github.com:modera/mcloud.git

Install package in "editable" mode::

    sudo /opt/mcloud/bin/pip install -e /path/to/cloned/dir

Now you have system-wide installed mcloud executalbles that are pointing to your cloned version.

To revert to public version from pypi::

    sudo /opt/mcloud/bin/pip uninstall mcloud
    sudo /opt/mcloud/bin/pip install mcloud
