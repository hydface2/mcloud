Deploying hello website
===============================================

assume we have a hello web-page, that we want to deploy
as mcloud application::

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello, mcloud!
    </body>
    </html>


To deploy this we need the following mcloud.yml configuration::

    web:
        image: orchardup/nginx

        volumes:
            public: /var/www


This will create one service called "web".
We use "orchardup/nginx" image that contains nginx that serve everything inside /var/www directory.

In mcloud.yml we specify, that we will mount current directory to /var/www volume inside container.
So, our public directory will be accessible from web.

Application structure is following::

 - public
    - index.html
 - mflcoud.yml

Now, start mcloud shell::

    $ mcloud

mcloud will show command prompt::

    mcloud: ~@me>


Now we can init our application with "init" command::

    mcloud: ~@me> init hello

"hello" is name of our application.

List command will show our newly created application::

    mcloud: ~@me> list

    +------------------+--------+-------+--------+-------------------------------+----------------------------+
    | Application name | status | cpu % | memory |              Web              |            Path            |
    +------------------+--------+-------+--------+-------------------------------+----------------------------+
    |      hello      |        |       |        | hello.mcloud.lh -> [No web] | /home/alex/dev/mcloud/tmp |
    +------------------+--------+-------+--------+-------------------------------+----------------------------+

We can "use" new application, so we don't need to typ application name every time::

    mcloud: ~@me>  use hello

    mcloud: hello@me>

Now, lets start our application::

    mcloud: hello@me>  start
    hello None
    [2646] Starting application
    [2646] Got response
    [2646] Service web.hello is not created. Creating

    **************************************************

     Service web.hello

    **************************************************
    [2646] Service web.hello is not running. Starting
    [2646][web.hello] Starting service
    [2646][web.hello] Service resolve by name result: 72e364366f1c536b35d602e7c5c29449e65af9094c12d5118f3720a88e4c3d50
    [2646][web.hello] Starting service...
    Startng container with config: {'Binds': ['/home/alex/dev/mcloud/tmp/public:/var/www', '/var/run/mcloud:/var/run/mcloud', '/home/alex/dev/mcloud/mcloud/api.py:/usr/bin/@me'], 'DnsSearch': u'hello.mcloud.lh', 'Dns': ['172.17.42.1']}
    Updating container list
    result: u'Done.'

    mcloud: hello@me>


And list will show the following::

    mcloud: hello@me>  status

    +--------------+--------+------------+-------+--------+----------+--------------------------+
    | Service name | status |     ip     | cpu % | memory | volumes  |       public urls        |
    +--------------+--------+------------+-------+--------+----------+--------------------------+
    |  web.hello  |   ON   | 172.17.0.2 | 0.07% |  12M   | /var/www | http://hello.mcloud.lh |
    +--------------+--------+------------+-------+--------+----------+--------------------------+


More detailed info about current application::


Couple of things to notice from the output:
- application is now in running state
- assigned IP address is 172.17.0.2
- the web container is detected to expose port 80 thus it is mapped to special internal domain address hello.mcloud.lh


Lets use Curl to load the web page (in separate terminal)::

    $ curl 172.17.0.2

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Hello, mcloud!
    </body>
    </html>

You should see same output if you use::

    $ curl hello.mcloud.lh


Open url in browser
---------------------------------------

If you are running mcloud natively on **linux**, then opening url in browser should just work.

In case of **MacOS/Windows with Vagrant**, you need to add following into /etc/hosts (or similar file in Windows)::

    192.168.70.2    hello.mcloud.lh

192.168.70.2 - is ip address you assigned in your Vagrantfile.


Stopping and removing an app
---------------------------------------

Stop the application::

    mcloud: hello@me>  stop
    [2649] Stoping application
    [2649] Got response
    [2649] Service web.hello is running. Stoping
    result: u'Done.'


Now we see that web.service is OFF, it means that there is container created, but itâ€™s not running. When application is stopped, it preserves all the data that was in container.
If you need to remove the data but keep the application in registry, run::

    mcloud: hello@me>  destroy hello
    [2650] Destroying application containers
    [2650] Got response
    [2650] Destroying container: None
    [2650] Service web.hello container is created. Destroying
    result: u'Done.'

If you need to remove all traces of the application, run::

    mcloud: hello@me>  remove hello
    [2651] Destroying application containers
    [2651] Got response
    [2651] Destroying container: None
    [2651] Service web.hello container is not yet created.
    result: u'Done.'
